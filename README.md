# KPMG Yearly Performance Review

**Summary**

The project focuses on conducting a thorough business analytics of KPMG's yearly performance, primarily using SQL and Excel. This analysis includes a monthly trend analysis of revenue and profitability, distribution by product types, alongside a segmentation of the customers. Eight distinct customer segmentations are created based on recency, frequency, and monetary metrics. These customer segments include :

• At Risk

• High-Value Customers

• Spenders

• Loyal Customers

• Promising Customers

• Mid-Value Customers

• Churned Customers

• Best Customers

This analysis helps the company with data-driven insights for strategic decision-making, enabling them to maximize profitability for different brands, and testing targeted marketing strategies for each market segment.
